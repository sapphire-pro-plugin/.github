## What is Sapphire used for?
Sapphire is an industry-standard toolkit that is used to add a high level of creative polish and cinematic quality to video and film projects. Its main applications include:

- Cinematic Lighting Effects: Creating photorealistic lens flares, glows, glints, and light leaks to enhance a shot's atmosphere and production value.

- Stylization and Looks: Applying a wide variety of stylized effects, such as film damage, glitches, film grain, cartoon looks, and retro TV effects.

- Creative Transitions: Using a vast library of auto-animating, high-quality transitions to move between shots, from subtle blurs to mind-bending, custom-designed effects.

- Image Processing: Using a robust set of tools for color grading, blurs, and distortions to achieve specific visual goals.

- Compositing and Rendering: Generating procedural elements like textures, starfields, and caustics to enhance or build out a scene.

## Key Features of Sapphire
1. Massive Effects and Presets Library:

- Sapphire includes over 270 effects and thousands of professional, customizable presets. This allows artists to achieve a high-end look instantly with a single click, which can then be fine-tuned to their specific needs.

2. Integrated Mocha Tracking:

- Like other Boris FX products, Sapphire has integrated the Academy Award-winning Mocha planar tracking engine. This allows you to apply effects, masks, and paint-outs to specific moving objects in your footage with exceptional precision and without the need for manual keyframing.

3. Effect and Transition Builder:

- This unique feature allows you to combine multiple Sapphire effects into a single custom effect or transition. You can build complex looks from scratch or modify existing presets, saving your creations for future use.

4. Superior Image Quality:

- Sapphire is known for its high-quality image processing algorithms that produce organic, natural-looking results. The effects are designed to look realistic and avoid the "digital" feel of native host effects.


5. GPU Acceleration:

- The entire suite is heavily optimized for GPU acceleration using NVIDIA CUDA and Apple's Metal technology. This results in incredibly fast rendering times, allowing for a more fluid and interactive creative process, even with complex effects.
